##### A11.1 Self Defence - 
Requisites:
1. Unlawful Aggression
2. Defenders means to repel attack is necessary
3. No Provocation on part of defender

Defense of BODY and RIGHTS. Rights includes, property, and right to HONOR.
[[Jaurige 1946]] mentioning Viada, Codigo Penal

[[Unlawful Aggression Test]] is the *sine qua non* of the three self defense elements. [[Ganal 2011]]
Elements are
1.  **PHYSICAL OR MATERIAL attack
2.  **ACTUAL or atleast IMMINENT**
3.  **UNLAWFUL**
   
Retaliation is not Self Defense [[Cajurao 2004]].

Settled rule in Jurisprudence - when aggreesor flee, unlawful aggression ceasts, so must the defender. [[Alconga 1947]]

Homicide is justifiable if attack and defense actions are simultaneous, or atleast have no appreciable interval of time if in sequence. [[Ferrer 1901]] 
Unless fleeing is to take an advantageous position.

Nature, character, location, and extent of wound can belie Self Defense. In absence of witnesses, the physical facts can contradict the self defense claim.  21 stab wounds. [[Batas 1989]] 

Disarmed aggressor can still pose a threat.  [[Samson 2015]]

Agreement to fight is not Self Defense, same with accepting a challenge. [[Gondayao 1969]]

Stand your ground when in the right. Law does not require a defender to flee to claim self defense. [[Domen 1917]]

Self defense valid even for Toy gun, as long as accused believed it was. 

Law not only protects person who repels an aggression, but even the person who tries to prevent an aggression that is expected. [[Batungbacal 1918]]

Defenses of mentioned in a11 1 to 3:
	1. Womans Honor [[Jaurige 1946]]
	2. Property Civil Code Art. 429 
		This is the so called “**the doctrine of self help**” where a person can sort of “take the law into his own hands” in order to protect his property.
	3. Home [[Rivera 1929]]

Doctrine of Rational Equivalence [[Encomendia 1972]]
