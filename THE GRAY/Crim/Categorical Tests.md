#### Guilt in Rape 
[[Jacinto 2011]]

> 1. an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove;
> 2. in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and
> 3. the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
