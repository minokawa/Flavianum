> Once again, we recite the time-honored principle that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the victim’s positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.[1](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt1) For it to prosper, the court must be convinced that there was physical impossibility on the part of the accused to have been at the _locus criminis_ at the time of the commission of the crime.[2](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt2)

> 
> In an Information dated 20 March 2003[5](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt5) filed with the Regional Trial Court and docketed as Criminal Case No. 1679-13-141[1],[6](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt6) appellant was accused of the crime of RAPE allegedly committed as follows:
> 
> That on or about the 28th day of January, 2003 at about 7:00 o’clock in the evening more or less, at barangay xxx, municipality of xxx, province of xxx and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, [Hermie M. Jacinto], with lewd design did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge with one AAA, a five-year old minor child.
> 
> CONTRARY TO LAW, with the qualifying/aggravating circumstance of minority, the victim being only five years old.[7](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt7)
> 
> On 15 July 2003, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.[8](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt8) During pre-trial,[9](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt9) the defense admitted the existence of the following documents: (1) birth certificate of AAA, showing that she was born on 3 December 1997; (2) police blotter entry on the rape incident; and (3) medical certificate, upon presentation of the original or upon identification thereof by the physician.
> 
> Trial ensued with the prosecution and the defense presenting witnesses to prove their respective versions of the story.

> _Evidence for the Prosecution_
> 
> The testimonies of AAA,[10](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt10) her father FFF,[11](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt11) and rebuttal witness Julito Apiki [Julito][12](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt12) may be summarized in the following manner:
> 
> FFF and appellant have been neighbors since they were born. FFF’s house is along the road. That of appellant lies at the back approximately 80 meters from FFF. To access the road, appellant has to pass by FFF’s house, the frequency of which the latter describes to be "every minute [and] every hour." Also, appellant often visits FFF because they were close friends. He bore no grudge against appellant prior to the incident.[13](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt13)
> 
> AAA likewise knows appellant well. She usually calls him _kuya._ She sees him all the time – playing at the basketball court near her house, fetching water, and passing by her house on his way to the road. She and appellant used to be friends until the incident.[14](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt14)
> 
> At about past 6 o’clock in the evening of 28 January 2003, FFF sent his eight-year-old daughter CCC to the store of Rudy Hatague to buy cigarettes. AAA followed CCC. When CCC returned without AAA, FFF was not alarmed. He thought she was watching television at the house of her aunt Rita Lingcay [Rita].[15](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt15)
> 
> Julito went to the same store at around 6:20 in the evening to buy a bottle of Tanduay Rum.[16](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt16) At the store, he saw appellant place AAA on his lap.[17](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt17) He was wearing sleeveless shirt and a pair of short pants.[18](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt18) All of them left the store at the same time.[19](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt19) Julito proceeded to the house of Rita to watch television, while appellant, who held the hand of AAA, went towards the direction of the "lower area or place."[20](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt20)
> 
> AAA recalled that appellant was wearing a _chaleko_ (sando) and a pair of short pants[21](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt21) when he held her hand while on the road near the store.[22](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt22) They walked towards the rice field near the house of spouses Alejandro and Gloria Perocho [the Perochos].[23](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt23) There he made her lie down on harrowed ground, removed her panty and boxed her on the chest.[24](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt24) Already half-naked from waist down,[25](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt25) he mounted her, and, while her legs were pushed apart, pushed his penis into her vagina and made a push and pull movement.[26](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt26) She felt pain and cried.[27](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt27) Afterwards, appellant left and proceeded to the Perochos.[28](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt28) She, in turn, went straight home crying.[29](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt29)
> 
> FFF heard AAA crying and calling his name from downstairs.[30](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt30) She was without slippers.[31](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt31) He found her face greasy.[32](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt32) There was mud on her head and blood was oozing from the back of her head.[33](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt33) He checked for any injury and found on her neck a contusion that was already turning black.[34](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt34) She had no underwear on and he saw white substance and mud on her vagina.[35](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt35) AAA told him that appellant brought her from the store[36](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt36) to the grassy area at the back of the house of the Perochos;[37](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt37) that he threw away her pair of slippers, removed her panty, choked her and boxed her breast;[38](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt38) and that he proceeded thereafter to the Perochos.[39](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt39)
> 
> True enough, FFF found appellant at the house of the Perochos.[40](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt40) He asked the appellant what he did to AAA.[41](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt41) Appellant replied that he was asked to buy rum at the store and that AAA followed him.[42](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt42) FFF went home to check on his daughter,[43](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt43) afterwhich, he went back to appellant, asked again,[44](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt44) and boxed him.[45](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt45)
> 
> Meanwhile, at around 7:45 in the evening of even date, Julito was still watching television at the house of Rita.[46](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt46) AAA and her mother MMM arrived.[47](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt47) AAA was crying.[48](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt48) Julito pitied her, embraced her, and asked what happened to her, to which she replied that appellant raped her.[49](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt49) Julito left and found appellant at the Perochos.[50](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt50) Julito asked appellant, "Bads, did you really rape the child, the daughter of [MMM]?" but the latter ignored his question.[51](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt51) Appellant’s aunt, Gloria, told appellant that the policemen were coming to which the appellant responded, "Wait a minute because I will wash the dirt of my elbow (sic) and my knees."[52](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt52) Julito did found the elbows and knees of appellant with dirt.[53](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt53)
> 
> On that same evening, FFF and AAA proceeded to the police station to have the incident blottered.[54](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt54) FFF also had AAA undergo a physical check up at the municipal health center.[55](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt55) Dr. Bernardita M. Gaspar, M.D., Rural Health Physician, issued a medical certificate[56](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt56) dated 29 January 2003. It reads:

Dr. Christine Ruth B. Micabalo, Medical Officer III of the provincial hospital, attended to her and issued a medico-legal certificate dated 29 January 2003,[58](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt58) the pertinent portion of which reads:

> 
> _Evidence for the Defense_
> 
> Interposing the defense of alibi, appellant gave a different version of the story. To corroborate his testimony, Luzvilla Balucan [Luzvilla] and his aunt Gloria took the witness stand to affirm that he was at the Perochos at the time of the commission of the crime.[60](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt60) Luzvilla even went further to state that she actually saw Julito, not appellant, pick up AAA on the road.[61](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt61) In addition, Antonia Perocho [Antonia], sister-in-law of appellant’s aunt, Gloria,[62](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt62) testified on the behavior of Julito after the rape incident was revealed.[63](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt63)
> 
> Appellant claimed that he lives with his aunt, not with his parents whose house stands at the back of FFF’s house.[64](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt64) He denied that there was a need to pass by the house of FFF in order to access the road or to fetch water.[65](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt65) He, however, admitted that he occasionally worked for FFF,[66](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt66) and whenever he was asked to buy something from the store, AAA always approached him.[67](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt67)
> 
> At about 8 o’clock in the morning of 28 January 2003, appellant went to the Perochos to attend a birthday party. At 6:08 in the evening, while the visitors, including appellant and his uncle Alejandro Perocho [Alejandro], were gathered together in a drinking session, appellant’s uncle sent him to the store to buy Tanduay Rum. Since the store is only about 20 meters from the house, he was able to return after three (3) minutes. He was certain of the time because he had a watch .[68](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt68)
> 
> Appellant’s aunt, Gloria, the lady of the house, confirmed that he was in her house attending the birthday party; and that appellant went out between 6 and 7 in the evening to buy a bottle of Tanduay from the store. She recalled that appellant was back around five (5) minutes later. She also observed that appellant’s white shorts and white sleeveless shirt were clean.[69](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt69)
> 
> At 6:30 in the evening,[70](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt70) Luzvilla, who was also at the party, saw appellant at the kitchen having a drink with his uncle Alejandro and the rest of the visitors.[71](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt71) She went out to relieve herself at the side of the tree beside the road next to the house of the Perochos.[72](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt72) From where she was, she saw Julito, who was wearing black short pants and black T-shirt, carry AAA.[73](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt73) AAA’s face was covered and she was wiggling.[74](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt74) This did not alarm her because she thought it was just a game.[75](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt75) Meanwhile, appellant was still in the kitchen when she returned.[76](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt76) Around three (3) minutes later, Luzvilla saw Julito, now in a white T-shirt,[77](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt77) running towards the house of Rita.[78](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt78) AAA was slowly following behind.[79](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt79) Luzvilla followed them.[80](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt80) Just outside the house, Julito embraced AAA and asked what the appellant did to her.[81](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt81) The child did not answer.[82](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt82)
> 
> Luzvilla also followed FFF to the Perochos. She witnessed the punching incident and testified that appellant was twice boxed by FFF. According to her, FFF tapped the left shoulder of the appellant, boxed him, and left. FFF came in the second time and again boxed appellant. This time, he had a bolo pointed at appellant. Appellant’s uncle Alejandro, a barangay councilor, and another Civilian Voluntary Organization (CVO) member admonished FFF.[83](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt83)
> 
> On sur-rebuttal, Antonia testified that, at 7 o’clock in the evening, she was watching the television along with other people at the house of Rita. Around 7:10, Julito, who was wearing only a pair of black short pants without a shirt on, entered the house drunk. He paced back and forth. After 10 minutes, AAA came in crying. Julito tightly embraced AAA and asked her what happened. AAA did not answer. Upon Antonia’s advice, Julito released her and went out of the house.[84](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt84)
> 
> Appellant further testified that at past 7 o’clock in the evening, FFF arrived, pointed a finger at him, brandished a bolo, and accused him of molesting AAA. FFF left but returned at around 8 o’clock in the evening. This time, he boxed appellant and asked again why he molested his daughter.[85](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt85)

> On 26 March 2004, the Regional Trial Court rendered its decision,[86](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt86) the dispositive portion of which reads:
> 
> WHEREFORE, finding accused Hermie M.

With costs[87](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt87)
> 
> The defense moved to reopen trial for reception of newly discovered evidence stating that appellant was apparently born on 1 March 1985 and that he was only seventeen (17) years old when the crime was committed on 28 January 2003.[88](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt88) The trial court appreciated the evidence and reduced the penalty from death to _reclusion perpetua_.[89](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt89) Thus:
> 
> WHEREFORE, the judgment of the court imposing the death penalty upon the accused is amended in order to consider the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority. The penalty impos[a]ble upon the accused, therefore[,] is reduced to reclusion perpetua. xxx
> 
> Appealed to this Court, the case was transferred to the Court of Appeals for its disposition in view of the ruling in _People v. Mateo_ and the _Internal Rules of the Supreme Court_ allowing an intermediate review by the Court of Appeals of cases where the penalty imposed is death_, reclusion perpetua,_ or life imprisonment.[90](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt90)

Appellant Hermie M. Jacinto is ordered to indemnify the victim in the sum of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay the costs.[91](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt91)

> 
> **_Our Ruling_**
> 
> We sustain the judgment of conviction.
> 
> In the determination of the innocence or guilt of a person accused of rape, we consider the three well-entrenched principles:
> 
> (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.[97](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt97)
> 
> Necessarily, the credible, natural, and convincing testimony of the victim may be sufficient to convict the accused.[98](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt98) More so, when the testimony is supported by the medico-legal findings of the examining physician.[99](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt99)
> 
> Further, the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the victim’s positive identification of the perpetrator of the crime,[100](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt100) except when it is established that it was physically impossible for the accused to have been at the _locus criminis_ at the time of the commission of the crime.[101](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt101)

> A man commits rape by having carnal knowledge of a child under twelve (12) years of age even in the absence of any of the following circumstances: (a) through force, threat or intimidation; (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority.[102](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt102)
> 
> That the crime of rape has been committed is certain. The vivid narration of the acts culminating in the insertion of appellant’s organ into the vagina of five-year-old AAA and the medical findings of the physicians sufficiently proved such fact.

> The straightforward and consistent answers to the questions, which were phrased and re-phrased in order to test that AAA well understood the information elicited from her, said it all – she had been raped. When a woman, more so a minor, says so, she says in effect all that is essential to show that rape was committed.[104](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt104) Significantly, youth and immaturity are normally badges of truth and honesty.[105](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt105)

> Further, the medical findings and the testimony of Dr. Micabalo[106](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt106) revealed that the hymenal lacerations at 5 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions could have been caused by the penetration of an object; that the redness of the introitus could have been "the result of the repeated battering of the object;" and that such object could have been an erect male organ.[107](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt107)
> 
> The credible testimony of AAA corroborated by the physician’s finding of penetration conclusively established the essential requisite of carnal knowledge.[108](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt108)

> The real identity of the assailant and the whereabouts of the appellant at the time of the commission of the crime are now in dispute.

> The defense would want us to believe that it was Julito who defiled AAA, and that appellant was elsewhere when the crime was committed.[109](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt109)
> 
> We should not, however, overlook the fact that a victim of rape could readily identify her assailant, _especially when he is not a stranger to her_, considering that she could have a good look at him during the commission of the crime_._[110](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt110) AAA had known appellant all her life. Moreover, appellant and AAA even walked together from the road near the store to the _situs criminus_[111](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt111) that it would be impossible for the child not to recognize the man who held her hand and led her all the way to the rice field.
> 
> We see no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court on the unwavering testimony of AAA.
> 
> The certainty of the child, unusually intelligent for one so young, that it was accused, whom she called "kuya" and who used to play basketball and fetch water near their house, and who was wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts at the time he raped her, was convincing and persuasive. The defense attempted to impute the crime to someone else – one Julito Apiki, but the child, on rebuttal, was steadfast and did not equivocate, asserting that it was accused who is younger, and not Julito, who is older, who molested her.[112](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt112)
> 
> In a long line of cases, this Court has consistently ruled that the determination by the trial court of the credibility of the witnesses deserves full weight and respect considering that it has "the opportunity to observe the witnesses’ manner of testifying, their furtive glances, calmness, sighs and the scant or full realization of their oath,"[113](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt113) unless it is shown that material facts and circumstances have been "ignored, overlooked, misconstrued, or misinterpreted."[114](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt114)
> 
> Further, as correctly observed by the trial court:
> 
> xxx His and his witness’ attempt to throw the court off the track by imputing the crime to someone else is xxx a vain exercise in view of the private complainant’s positive identification of accused and other corroborative circumstances. Accused also admitted that on the same evening, Julito Apiki, the supposed real culprit, asked him "What is this incident, _Pare?_", thus corroborating the latter’s testimony that he confronted accused after hearing of the incident from the child."[115](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt115)
> 
> On the other hand, we cannot agree with the appellant that the trial court erred in finding his denial and alibi weak despite the presentation of witnesses to corroborate his testimony. Glaring inconsistencies were all over their respective testimonies that even destroyed the credibility of the appellant’s very testimony.
> 
> Appellant testified that it was his uncle Alejandro Perocho who sent him to store to buy Tanduay; that he gave the bottle to his uncle; and that they had already been drinking long before he bought Tanduay at the store.
> 
> This was contradicted by the testimony of his aunt Gloria, wife of his uncle Alejandro. On cross-examination, she revealed that her husband was not around before, during, and after the rape incident because he was then at work.[116](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt116) He arrived from work only after FFF came to their house for the second time and boxed appellant.[117](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt117) It was actually the fish vendor, not her husband, who asked appellant to buy Tanduay.[118](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt118) Further, the drinking session started only after the appellant’s errand to the store.[119](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt119)
> 
> Neither was the testimony of Luzvilla credible enough to deserve consideration.
> 
> Just like appellant, Luzvilla testified that Alejandro joined the drinking session. This is contrary to Gloria’s statement that her husband was at work.
> 
> Luzvilla’s testimony is likewise inconsistent with that of sur-rebuttal witness Antonia Perocho. Antonia recalled that Julito arrived without a shirt on. This belied Luzvilla’s claim that Julito wore a white shirt on his way to the house of Rita. In addition, while both the prosecution, as testified to by AAA and Julito, and the defense, as testified to by Gloria, were consistent in saying that appellant wore a sleeveless shirt, Luzvilla’s recollection differ in that Julito wore a T-shirt (colored black and later changed to white), and, thus, a short-sleeved shirt.
> 
> Also, contrary to Luzvilla’s story that she saw AAA walking towards Rita’s house three (3) minutes after she returned to the Perochos at 6:38 in the evening, Antonia recalled that AAA arrived at the house of Rita at 7:30. In this respect, we find the trial court’s appreciation in order. Thus:
> 
> xxx. The child declared that after being raped, she went straight home, crying, to tell her father that Hermie had raped her. She did not first drop into the house of Lita Lingkay to cry among strangers who were watching TV, as Luzvilla Balucan would have the court believe. When the child was seen at the house of Lita Lingkay by Julito Apiki and Luzvilla Balucan, it was only later, after she had been brought there by her mother Brenda so that Lita Lingkay could take a look at her ˗ just as Julito Apiki said.[120](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt120)
> 
> Above all, for alibi to prosper, it is necessary that the corroboration is credible, the same having been offered preferably by disinterested witnesses. The defense failed thuswise. Its witnesses cannot qualify as such, "they being related or were one way or another linked to each other."[121](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt121)
> 
> Even assuming for the sake of argument that we consider the corroborations on his whereabouts, still, the defense of alibi cannot prosper.
> 
> We reiterate, time and again, that the court must be convinced that it would be physically impossible for the accused to have been at the _locus criminis_ at the time of the commission of the crime.[122](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt122)
> 
> Physical impossibility refers to distance and the facility of access between the _situs criminis_ and the location of the accused when the crime was committed. He must demonstrate that he was so far away and could not have been physically present at the scene of the crime and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed.[123](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt123)

> In _People v. Paraiso_,[124](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt124) the distance of two thousand meters from the place of the commission of the crime was considered not physically impossible to reach in less than an hour even by foot.[125](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt125) Inasmuch as it would take the accused not more than five minutes to rape the victim, this Court disregarded the testimony of the defense witness attesting that the accused was fast asleep when she left to gather bamboo trees and returned several hours after. She could have merely presumed that the accused slept all throughout.[126](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt126)

> In _People v. Antivola_,[127](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt127) the testimonies of relatives and friends corroborating that of the appellant that he was in their company at the time of the commission of the crime were likewise disregarded by this Court in the following manner:
> 
> Ruben Nicolas, the appellant’s part-time employer, and Marites Capalad, the appellant’s sister-in-law and co-worker, in unison, vouched for the appellant’s physical presence in the fishpond at the time Rachel was raped. It is, however, an established fact that **the appellant’s house where the rape occurred, was a stone’s throw away from the fishpond**. **Their claim that the appellant never left their sight the entire afternoon** of December 4, 1997 **is unacceptable**. It was impossible for Marites to have kept an eye on the appellant for almost four hours, since she testified that she, too, was very much occupied with her task of counting and recording the fishes being harvested. Likewise, Mr. Nicolas, who, admittedly was 50 meters away from the fishpond, could not have focused his entire attention solely on the appellant. **It is, therefore, not farfetched that the appellant easily sneaked out unnoticed, and along the way inveigled the victim, brought her inside his house and ravished her, then returned to the fishpond as if he never left**.[128](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt128) _(Emphasis supplied.)_1avvphi1
> 
> As in the cases above cited, the claim of the defense witnesses that appellant never left their sight, save from the 5-minute errand to the store, is contrary to ordinary human experience. Moreover, considering that the farmland where the crime was committed is just behind the house of the Perochos, it would take appellant only a few minutes to bring AAA from the road near the store next to the Perochos down the farmland and consummate the crime. As correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, appellant could have committed the rape after buying the bottle of Tanduay and immediately returned to his uncle’s house.[129](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt129) Unfortunately, the testimonies of his corroborating witnesses even bolstered the fact that he was within the immediate vicinity of the scene of the crime.[130](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt130)

> 
> In the present case, we agree with the Court of Appeals that: "(1) choosing an isolated and dark place to perpetrate the crime, to prevent detection[;] and (2) boxing the victim xxx, to weaken her defense" are indicative of then seventeen (17) year-old appellant’s mental capacity to fully understand the consequences of his unlawful action.[139](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt139)

> 
> Under Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code, when the offender is a minor under 18 years, the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall be imposed, but always in the proper period. **However, for purposes of determining the proper penalty because of the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority, the penalty of death is still the penalty to be reckoned with.** Thus, the proper imposable penalty for the accused-appellant is _reclusion perpetua._[148](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt148) _(Emphasis supplied.)_

And, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence,[152](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt152) the amount of exemplary damages should be increased from ₱25,000.00 to ₱30,000.00.

The said P.D. and Supreme Court (SC) Rule provide that the benefit of suspended sentence would not apply to a child in conflict with the law if, among others, he/she has been convicted of an offense punishable by death, _reclusion perpetua_ or life imprisonment. In construing Sec. 38 of R.A. No. 9344, the Court is guided by the basic principle of statutory construction that when the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish. Since R.A. No. 9344 does not distinguish between a minor who has been convicted of a capital offense and another who has been convicted of a lesser offense, the Court should also not distinguish and should apply the automatic suspension of sentence to a child in conflict with the law who has been found guilty of a heinous crime.[157](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt157)
> 
> The legislative intent reflected in the Senate deliberations[158](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt158) on Senate Bill No. 1402 (Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 2005) further strengthened the new position of this Court to cover heinous crimes in the application of the provision on the automatic suspension of sentence of a child in conflict with the law. The pertinent portion of the deliberation reads:
> 
> If a mature minor, maybe 16 years old to below 18 years old is charged, accused with, or may have committed a serious offense, and may have acted with discernment, then the child could be recommended by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), by the Local Council for the Protection of Children (LCPC), or by [Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago’s] proposed Office of Juvenile Welfare and Restoration to go through a judicial proceeding; but _the welfare, best interests, and restoration of the child should still be a primordial or primary consideration. Even in heinous crimes, the intention should still be the child’s restoration, rehabilitation and reintegration._ xxx (Italics supplied in _Sarcia_.)[159](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt159)
> 
> On 24 November 2009, the Court _En Banc_ promulgated the _Revised Rule on Children in Conflict with the Law_, which reflected the same position_._[160](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt160)
> 
> These developments notwithstanding, we find that the benefits of a suspended sentence can no longer apply to appellant. The suspension of sentence lasts only until the child in conflict with the law reaches the maximum age of twenty-one (21) years.[161](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt161) Section 40[162](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt162) of the law and Section 48[163](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt163) of the Rule are clear on the matter. Unfortunately, appellant is now twenty-five (25) years old.
> 
> Be that as it may, to give meaning to the legislative intent of the Act, the promotion of the welfare of a child in conflict with the law should extend even to one who has exceeded the age limit of twenty-one (21) years, so long as he/she committed the crime when he/she was still a child. The offender shall be entitled to the right to restoration, rehabilitation and reintegration in accordance with the Act in order that he/she is given the chance to live a normal life and become a productive member of the community. The age of the child in conflict with the law at the time of the promulgation of the judgment of conviction is not material. What matters is that the offender committed the offense when he/she was still of tender age.
> 
> Thus, appellant may be confined in an agricultural camp or any other training facility in accordance with Sec. 51 of Republic Act No. 9344.[164](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt164)
> 
> Sec. 51. _Confinement of Convicted Children in Agricultural Camps and Other Training Facilities._ – A child in conflict with the law may, after conviction and upon order of the court, be made to serve his/her sentence, in lieu of confinement in a regular penal institution, in an agricultural camp and other training facilities that may be established, maintained, supervised and controlled by the BUCOR, in coordination with the DSWD.
> 
> Following the pronouncement in Sarcia,[165](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2011/mar2011/gr_182239_2011.html#fnt165) the case shall be remanded to the court of origin to effect appellant’s confinement in an agricultrual camp or other training facility.
> 
> **WHEREFORE**, the Decision dated 29 August 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00213 finding appellant Hermie M. Jacinto guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified rape is **AFFIRMED** with the following **MODIFICATIONS**: (1) the death penalty imposed on the appellant is reduced to _reclusion perpetua_; and (2) appellant is ordered to pay the victim P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages. The case is hereby **REMANDED** to the court of origin for its appropriate action in accordance with Section 51 of Republic Act No. 9344.
