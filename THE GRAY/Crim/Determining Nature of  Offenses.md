#### Intent and Discernment 
[[Guevarra vs Alvodar 1989]]

From the foregoing, it is clear that the terms "intent" and "discernment" convey two distinct thoughts. 

- Both are products of the mental processes within a person, 
- former refers to desired of one's act
- latter relates to moral significance that person ascribes to the act. 	
##### Illustration:
A person may not intend to shoot another, but aware of the consequences of his negligent act 

**Intent** - He may negligently shoot his friend thus did not intend to shoot him
**Discernment** - and at the same time recognize the undesirable result of his negligence.

It is not correct to argue,  
**Discernment** - Since a minor above nine years of age but below fifteen acted with discernment, 
**Intent** - Then he intended such act to be done.* 

Rationale of [[Article 12 of the RPC]]: 
- The complete absence of intelligence, freedom of action, or intent, or on the absence of negligence on the part of the accused.  In expounding on intelligence as the second element of _dolus_.
- The second element of _dolus_ is _intelligence_; _without this power, necessary to determine the morality of human acts to distinguish a licit from an illicit act,_ no crime can exist,

#### Discernment of a Minor 15-17 
[[Dorado 2016]]

that mental capacity of a minor to fully appreciate the consequences of his unlawful act.  Such capacity may be known and should be determined by taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances afforded by the records in each case.

he discernment that constitutes an exception to the exemption from criminal liability of a minor x x x who commits an act prohibited by law, is his mental capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong, and such capacity may be known and should be determined by taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances accorded by the records in each case, the very appearance, the very attitude, the very comportment and behavior of said minor, not only before and during the commission of the act, but also after and even during the trial

#### Repetition of Offense  
[[Quitong 1942]]
[[Bernal 1936]]

Rationale of  Art14(9), Art14(10) ,  Art62(5), to be severe on those who manifest criminal tendencies in order to curb criminality. The object is already attained when the additional penalty (which is very heavy compared with the principal) for habitual delinquency is applied.

 Counts in **Habitual delinquency**  shall in no case exceed 30 years. Recidivism as as an aggravating circumstances willl count.
	
	Quintong issue:  1st count is an aggravating, commiting it while on trial.
	Held:  aggravating circumstances still be counted in Habitual delinquency

- **Reiteration**, -  Serving of Sentence is needed
	- in Article 14 (10)
	- Current and Previous Offense NOT in same TITLE of Revised Penal Code
	- one Previous Sentence with equal or greater  penalty- relative to Current
	- two Previous Sentence with lighter penalty - relative to Current. 
	  
- **Recidivism** - Conviction is suffice
	- in Art 14 (9)
	- Current and Previous Offenses in same TITLE of Revised Penal Code
	- **IF**:  none robbery, theft, estafa and falsification 
		- number of previous convictions is immaterial
	- **IF**: robbery, theft, estafa and falsification . 
		- only one is needed
		- on two or more, not within the 10yr gap
	  
-  **Habitual delinquency** 
	- in Art 62 (5)
	- Specific to serious or less serious physical injuries, robbery,  theft,  estafa  or falsification,
	- two or more conviction, and last and current is within the 10year gap
	- Absorbs Recidivism
	
- **Quasi-recidivism** , Offense During Service of Penalty
	- in Art 160
	- convicted  before beginning to serve sentence or while serving such sentence 
	- shall be punished by the maximum period for latest offense


#### Repetition of Offense and Circumstances
**Article 62.** _Effect of the attendance of mitigating or aggravating circumstances and of habitual delinquency._ - Mitigating or aggravating circumstances and habitual delinquency shall be taken into account for the purpose of diminishing or increasing the penalty in conformity with the following rules:

1. Aggravating circumstances which in themselves constitute a crime specially punishable by law or which are included by the law in defining a crime and prescribing the penalty therefor shall not be taken into account for the purpose of increasing the penalty.
2. The same rule shall apply with respect to any aggravating circumstance inherent in the crime to such a degree that it must of necessity accompany the commission thereof.
3. Aggravating or mitigating circumstances which arise from the moral attributes of the offender, or from his private relations with the offended party, or from any other personal cause, shall only serve to aggravate or mitigate the liability of the principals, accomplices and accessories as to whom such circumstances are attendant.
4. The circumstances which consist in the material execution of the act, or in the means employed to accomplish it, shall serve to aggravate or mitigate the liability of those persons only who had knowledge of them at the time of the execution of the act or their cooperation therein.
